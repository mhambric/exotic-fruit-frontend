# Exotic Fruit Storefront Frontend

This project is a frontend demonstration of an online exotic fruit storefront. It focuses on user experience, client side logic, and clean interface design. The application allows users to browse products, view individual fruit details, manage a shopping cart, and see real time price updates.

This frontend is intentionally built without a live backend to clearly showcase frontend engineering skills and client side state management.

## Design Notes

This project was designed to simulate a real ecommerce experience while remaining fully static. It demonstrates how frontend applications can manage user state and navigation without relying on a backend service.

This frontend pairs with a separate backend and database project, which is documented in a different repository.
